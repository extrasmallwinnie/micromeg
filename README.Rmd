# micromeg

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of micromeg is to share convenience wrappers I use frequently for microbiome data analysis and processing. This package does not create anything new and is built on the great work of others. Many of the functions it provides already exist in other packages, such as [phyloseq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phyloseq.html).

## Installation

You can install the development version of micromeg from [GitHub](https://github.com/extrasmallwinnie/micromeg/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("extrasmallwinnie/micromeg")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(micromeg)

## Check your metadata file for potential errors and problems with checkMeta():

# dplyr supplies useful tibbles for us to use for testing. The object dplyr::band_members is a tibble with some well known people, and includes their first name and the band they're known for. View it in the console below:
dplyr::band_members

# If we run checkMeta, and we're going to use column "name" as our "Sample ID", we should get no warnings or errors as every name is unique:
checkMeta(dplyr::band_members, "name")
# No problems were detected with your metadata file.

# However, if we were to use "band" as our "Sample ID", we would get an error because not every entry in band is unique, so it can't function as a valid sample ID:
#checkMeta(dplyr::band_members, "band")
# Error in tryCatchList(expr, classes, parentenv, handlers) : 
#  You indicated the variable to use for the sample IDs was band. However, these are not all unique. All sample IDs # must be unique. Your duplicated sample IDs were: Beatles

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}

```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
